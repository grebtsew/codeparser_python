# codeparser_python

Parsing code involves reading each line of code from a file, then split the line and divide the code into tokens.
These tokens can then be filtered to be used in several areas. This repo contains a python3 abstract implementation of a parser using tokenize.generate_tokens.
Several functions have also been added to show how a parser can be used to help in the process of generating requirement files in python, for translating code to different languages and help document code.

# How to run the program?
Since this project contains a requirements-generator, there is a requirement file that can be used to install needed libraries.
To install needed python3 libraries with pip run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
